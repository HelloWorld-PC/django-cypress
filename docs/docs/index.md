## Installation

The first step is to install [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) as a development dependency.
```
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

Install the `django_cypress` package.
```
pip install django_cypress
```

Add the `django_cypress` app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` to the `settings.py` file:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_cypress'
    ...
]
```

Include the URLs of the `django_cypress` app to the `urls.py` file.
```python
urlpatterns = [
    path("", include("django_cypress.urls")),
]
```

Generate the Cypress boilerplate to copy over the initial boilerplate files for your Cypress tests.
```
python manage.py cypress_boilerplate
```

We have provided a `e2e/example.cy.js` spec for you as an example. Open Cypress.
```
npx cypress open
```
In the Cypress window that appears, select "E2E Testing," followed by
"Start E2E Testing in Chrome." This action will display a list of all 
the specs in your application. Click on `example.cy.js` to execute it.
